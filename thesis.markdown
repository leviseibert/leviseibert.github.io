As a part of my graduate comptuer science studies, I chose to write a thesis.  When trying to decide what to research, I decided I wanted my work to focused on something to do within the realm of AI.  That being said, cybersecurity has always been an important topic to me and I want to use my skills to actively help others.  
After much thought and discussions with professors, I eventually decided to go with reseearch into utilizng AI/ML to help protect against cyberattacks - particularly social engineering attacks.

My thesis, "Mitigating Social Engineering Threats With Machine Learning" is freely available on [ProQuest](https://www.proquest.com/docview/3123632664/70800E20DA91406CPQ/1?sourcetype=Dissertations%20&%20Theses)

As a part of this research, I developed a series of tools dubbed PhishingGraph (my thesis explains the name).  Check out my Github [repo](https://github.com/leviseibert/PhishingGraph) to learn more about this project and the tools I created.

**Next Steps**  
As you will read in the thesis, I had only moderate success - but only using OpenAI's API.  I wanted to utilize HuggingFace, but results were dissatisfactory (at best).  I plan on continuing this work, but if you have any recommendations, feel free to clone the repo and make suggestions.
