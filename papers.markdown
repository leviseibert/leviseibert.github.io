## School Papers

Throughout my undergraduate studies and graduate studies at Athens State University, I had writing assignments for various classes.  Please note that some of these are definitely less "developed" in nature, but they do illustrate my progression to the point where I am today; as well as illustrate some of my focus areas throughout the years.
