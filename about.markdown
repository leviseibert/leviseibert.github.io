## About This Site  
SeibertSecurity.com is a personal cybersecurity knowledge hub and learning blog built to map, document, and share my journey in security training, hands-on labs, and technical skill-building. Here, you'll find practical guides, virtual machine setups, security tool walkthroughs, and analysis of the latest threats and defenses.

## Who Am I?  
My name is Levi Seibert - I am a software engineer in Huntsville, Alabama.  My work is quite dynamic - I do a mix of software development, penetration testing, emulation/virtualization, reverse engineering, vulnerability research, and system analysis.  As such, my technical focus (and in turn, the focus of this site) will be in some of these fields.   

### Education
One of the greatest blessings of my life was being homeschooled my  my entire K-12 education.  This non-traditional academic style openned the door to me dual-enrolling in my local community college ([Calhoun Community College](https://calhoun.edu/)) while in high school.  Granted, non-homeschooled students certainly can also participate in dual enrollment, but the flexibilty of homeschool allowed me to complete my Associate's Degree in General Studies the same month I completed high school (which was also the month I turned 17).

I knew I wanted to get a CS/Cybersecurity degree from [Athens State University](https://www.athens.edu/) before I even started at Calhoun.  And that is what I did.  In Spring 2022, I was awarded a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Information Security and minors in Mathatmatics, Computer Forensics, and Computer Networking from Athens State University.  I graduated with a 3.96 GPA and was selected as I was selected as the 2022 Outstanding Computer Science graudate (granted it is a small CS department).  

I went on from there to puruse my Master of Science in Computer Science degree, also from Athens State University.  I was awarded that degree in Fall 2024.  As a part of my studies, I wrote a thesis entitiled, "Mitigating Social Engineering Threats with Machine Learning."  If you would like to learn more about this thesis and the research and application behind, it visit [Thesis](https://seibertsecurity.com/thesis/).  You can read other papers from my undergradaute and graduate studies at [School Papers](https://seibertsecurity.com/papers/).
