## About This Site  
SeibertSecurity.com is a personal cybersecurity knowledge hub and learning blog built to map, document, and share my journey in security training, hands-on labs, and technical skill-building. Here, you'll find practical guides, virtual machine setups, security tool walkthroughs, and analysis of the latest threats and defenses.

## Who Am I?  
My name is Levi Seibert - I am a software engineer in Huntsville, Alabama.  My work is quite dynamic - I do a mix of software development, emulation/virtualization, reverse engineering, vulnerability research, and system analysis.  As such, my technical focus (and in turn, the focus of this site) will be in some of these fields.   

### Education
I was awarded a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Information Security and minors in Mathatmatics, Computer Forensics, and Computer Networking from Athens State University in Spring 2022.  That year, I was selected as the 2022 Outstanding Computer Science graudate, earning a 3.96 GPA.
I went on from there to puruse my Master of Science in Computer Science degree, also from Athens State University.  I was awarded that degree in Fall 2024.  As a part of my studies, I wrote a thesis entitiled, "Mitigating Social Engineering Threats with Machine Learning."  If you would like to learn more about this thesis and the research and application behind, it visit [Thesis]().
