My name is Levi Seibert and this is my personal website.  I plan to use this site to track my cybersecurity knowledge base as I work to increase my skills and abilities.

I'm still working on what exactly this site will be, so stay tuned.  Who knows...maybe someday Seibert Security will be a consulting business!

If you have an questions or ideas, please don't hesitate to contact me!
